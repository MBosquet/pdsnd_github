### Project Title
Exploring US bikeshare Data

### Description
This project explores bikeshare Data in 3 major US cities: Chicago, New York City and Washington. The bikeshare.py file is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience to allow users to see major statistics from the bike-sharing system. There are four questions that will change the answers:

* Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
* Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
* (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
* (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?

After filtering the dataset, users will see the statistical result of the data, and choose to start again or exit.

### Files used
* bikeshare.py
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv
